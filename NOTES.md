## First Steps

### The Overview

This app will be a bit more complicated than the previous that I've done, and I'm kind of stoked about it. I've built a decent amount of responsive designs, done a bit of API calls and JSON handline, but I have not yet done...light/dark mode. Plus this project has user selectable font choices. Not really sure why I'm uncertain about it--probably just because it's new--and I'm thinking once I get going it'll all make sense.

First thoughts:
- The design is pretty straight-forward. It's a dictionary app so maybe that's to be expected. Even going from desktop down to mobile should present few issue because there really won't be a lot of re-arranging of the elements. Things will shrink and text will flow on to additional lines.
- Here's how I'm thinking of breaking down the build process:
  - Design system
  - Layouts plus media queries using the dummy information provided in the design
  - In-page functionality:
    - Buttons
    - Menus
    - Form validation (do I bring in some regex? ðŸ¤”)
    - Font selector
    - Light/dark mode selector (looks like I could try to animate the SVG?)
  - API interface
  - Additional functionality like playing the pronunciation and looking up other provided words from the synonyms/antonyms list

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
